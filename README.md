sketchfab-scene-exporter
===================
The goal of this script is to allow you to export the models contained in a Sketchfab scene to a Blender-ready format without ever leaving the browser.  

Usage
---------------------
A download button will appear inside the scene viewer (as shown in the image below) when viewing a Sketchfab scene. The donwload action will download each mesh in the scene to a .OBJ and a .MTL file, in addition to downloading all the required textures.
  
Installation
---------------------
If you have a userscript manager installed, clicking on [this link](https://github.com/reinitialized/sketchfab-scene-exporter/raw/master/sketchfab-scene-exporter.user.js) should bring up a prompt to install the script. 

Compatibility
---------------------
